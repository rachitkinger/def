## thinking again 
the job is to look at spectrum policy hurdles in universal access to Internet. 

Why spectrum policy? Because we believe Internet can be made available universally only via spectrum (ie. wifi) and not fixed line. 

To make it universally available the main focus is to reach underserved or (un-served) areas and/or groups of population. 

Where are these people? Rural areas with small pop, Hard to reach areas like hills, Urban slums. 

Why can't they get to internet right now? 
availability, affordability

Why can't it become available to everyone?
hard to reach, e.g. hilly terrain (can new tech solve this?) 
no business case (private suppliers)

what alternatives exist?
non-private options - by govt
non-private options - by local communities
semi-private options - local entreprenuers

what can govt do to establish PAS? What are the challenges?
infrastructure sharing (spectrum sharing)
community internet by using unallocated spectrum
