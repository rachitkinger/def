Notes on universal access to broadband Internet
================

Notes from 2017 Affordability Report by A4AI
--------------------------------------------

The report can be found [here](def/universal-access/background-research/A4AI-2017-Affordability-Report.pdf).

Report covers 58 low-mid income countries and tracks progress made towards:

-   drive Internet prices down
-   expand access

As per UN Sustainable Development Goals, target for [universal access](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/infrastructure-industrialization/) has been set as 2020 but with current rate of progress we will achieve it by 2042. 4Bn people are offline today (50% global Internet penetration), most of them women, and most of them in developing countries. Main reason: *cannot **afford** to connect*. Broadband prices are coming down but not fast enough.

Another problem: policy isn't changing fast enough. Report recommends *'smart'* policy changes that encourage **competition** and **innovation** in key areas, such as **spectrum**, **infrastructure** and **lasts-mile connectivity**. The rule of thumb pricing guideline is "1 for 2" - 1 GB data for no more than 2% of income. Only 19 of 58 countries have met this "1 for 2" target.

Six specific policy suggestions of the report:
1. Employ public access solutions (PAS) to close digital divide (DD)
2. Foster market competition through policy
3. Implement innovative uses of spectrum through transparent policy - e.g. support community networks or invest in developing new technology
4. Take urgent action to promote infrastructure and resource sharing
5. Make good use of Universal Service and Access Funds (USAFs)
6. Ensure effective bradband (bb) planning turns into effective implementation
