Affordability Report 2015-16
----------------------------

***Release date:** February 2016*
***Dataset:** 51 developing & emerging countries*
***Data on:** Policy frameworks. Analyses what is working to expand acess to affordable broadband.*
***Theme:** how poverty, income & gender inequality are masking the true state of affordability. What actions must policymakers take to overcome these barriers to access & make universal access a reality.*

### Highlights

#### Income inequality & poverty

25/51 countries have met the 5% affordability target for those earning avg national income but only 9/51 have achieved this for bottom 20% income levels. Lower income pop<sup>n</sup> is priced out.

*When costs drop to 2% of monthly incomes, access tends to be affordable for all income groups.*

Device cost not considered. When considered affordability drops by 20% across all countries. Report current analysis based on 500MB per month, which isn't meaningful Internet access.

#### Gender gap

Gender wage gap worses women's ability to afford Internet. Recent rsrch by Web Foundation shows that poor urban women are 50% less likely to be connected than men in the same age group with similar levels of edu & hh income.
SDGs 9c (universal access) and 5b (enhancing use of ICT to empower women) are under different overarching goals but they are linked. UA cannot be achieved w/o full gender equality and enabling women's access to **affordable**, **open** and **safe Internet**.

#### Main recommendations

1.  1f2 - 1GB of data priced at 2% or less of avg mothly income
2.  Reduce cost of mbl phones
    -   reform tax and patent regimes so bring down mbl phone costs

3.  Inc investment in & availability of PAS
    -   for those who will always be priced out of the market, create PAS e.g., libraries, etc. funded by USAFs

4.  Create specific, time-bound targets to close gender digital divide
    -   Govts must collect gender-disaggregated data to monitor progress
    -   Find out --&gt; how many men are online in India for every woman online (and what is the world benchmark broken down by - best, worst, avg)

5.  Integrated policy making that balances - demand & supply, regulation & competition, fixed-line & mobile, PAS & individual subscription

### Report notes

Affordability as defined by UN (500MB for 5%) is increasing but Internet growth is slowing down --- 7.4% in 2014, 6.9% in 2015 --- (**to-do:** find out what this number is for India & create international benchmarks). Report argues that this is because of combined effect of poverty and inequality. While poverty is decreasing, income inequality is increasing as well. Net result is that avg income is growing and therefore 500MB as 5% of income tends to be more affordable but lower income groups tend to get priced out. (**to-do:** find out what the avg income trend is for India and what prop of pop<sup>n</sup> lives below it. Compare this with international benchmarks).
Digital divide is a poverty and a gender divide.

### Affordability Drivers Index (ADI)

ADI examines factors associated with two sub-indexes:
1. Infrastructure
2. Access

In addition to these there is a the device cost and the cost associated with maintaining a device which the report acknowledges has been ignored in the ADI. When cost of phone @ $48 is included in the report affordability across the index falls by 20% but for India and Pakistan it falls by 60%. Govts can reduce taxes on smartphones - Côte d’Ivoire has reduced taxes to 6.6% from 26%.

Four broad categories to analyse:
1. Competition policy
2. Broadband policy
3. Universal Access
4. Infrastructure sharing
5. Spectrum policy

**No one policy** domain stands out as having the maximum influence on reducing price. This suggests that countries need a holistic perspective. No point focuing on supply while ignore demand.

### Poverty & Inequality - mistaken affordability

60% of countries have met UN's target of 500MB @ 5% (India is one of them) but despite that Internet penetration is low. For India 500MB costs 2.48% of per capita GNI but Internet penetration is 5.13%. For those living on less than $3.10/day cost of 500MB plan is 12% of income in India, and for those living on less than $1.90/day its at 19.5% of income. This is the effect of income inequality.
