Affordability Report 2015-16
----------------------------

***Release date:** February 2016*
***Dataset:** 51 developing & emerging countries*
***Data on:** Policy frameworks. Analyses what is working to expand acess to affordable broadband.*
***Theme:** how poverty, income & gender inequality are masking the true state of affordability. What actions must policymakers take to overcome these barriers to access & make universal access a reality.*

### Highlights

#### Income inequality & poverty

25/51 countries have met the 5% affordability target for those earning avg national income but only 9/51 have achieved this for bottom 20% income levels. Lower income pop<sup>n</sup> is priced out.

*When costs drop to 2% of monthly incomes, access tends to be affordable for all income groups.*

Device cost not considered. When considered affordability drops by 20% across all countries. Report current analysis based on 500MB per month, which isn't meaningful Internet access.

#### Gender gap

Gender wage gap worses women's ability to afford Internet. Recent rsrch by Web Foundation shows that poor urban women are 50% less likely to be connected than men in the same age group with similar levels of edu & hh income.
SDGs 9c (universal access) and 5b (enhancing use of ICT to empower women) are under different overarching goals but they are linked. UA cannot be achieved w/o full gender equality and enabling women's access to **affordable**, **open** and **safe Internet**.

#### Main recommendations

1.  1f2 - 1GB of data priced at 2% or less of avg mothly income
2.  Reduce cost of mbl phones
    -   reform tax and patent regimes so bring down mbl phone costs

3.  Inc investment in & availability of PAS
    -   for those who will always be priced out of the market, create PAS e.g., libraries, etc. funded by USAFs

4.  Create specific, time-bound targets to close gender digital divide
    -   Govts must collect gender-disaggregated data to monitor progress
    -   Find out --&gt; how many men are online in India for every woman online (and what is the world benchmark broken down by - best, worst, avg)

5.  Integrated policy making that balances - demand & supply, regulation & competition, fixed-line & mobile, PAS & individual subscription
